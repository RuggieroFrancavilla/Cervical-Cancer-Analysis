# Cervical-Cancer-Analysis
Many Machine Learning and Statistical techniques are applied to the Cervical Cancer dataset, to examine it in depth. 
The dataset is firstly explored, with an accurate data visualization analysis.
Then, some preprocessing techniques are applied, such as Standardization/Normalization, Dimensionality Reduction, Oversampling, and Outliers Management.
At the end, a comparison between different Classification Models is performed, by first examining them in depth from the theoretical point of view, and later comparing the performances on the specific analysis.
